You can configure:

- Up to 15 long tasks

Please note, that if the configured option exceeds the available number of tasks of a map, the tasks will be limited to that number of tasks. \
Example: If you configure 4 common tasks on Airship crewmates will only receive 2 common tasks, as airship doesn't offer more than 2 common tasks.
-----------------------

### Random Maps
**Play On A Random Map** If enabled it allows you to set percentages for each current map.

**Finish Tasks Before Haunting Or Zooming Out** You have to finish your tasks before you get the possibility to zoom out.

**Use Random Map Setting Presets:** When this option is turned on, the game will switch to the `Random Preset <MapName>` when a game is started on a random map. **This includes vanilla options!**. This makes it possible to e.g. play with less tasks on large maps like Airship.
The game will **remain** in the preset for that random map after the match.

The random map presets can still be used like normal presets, if you **turn of** `Play On A Random Map` (make sure you do this in all presets you are using).



# Custom Hats
## Create and submit new hat designs
We're awaiting your creative hat designs and we'll integrate all the good ones in our mod.
Here are a few instructions, on how to create a custom hat:

- **Creation:** A hat consists of up to three textures. The aspect ratio of the textures has to be `4:5`, we recommend `300px:375px`:
  - `Main texture (required)`:
    - This is the main texture of your hat. It will usually be rendered in front of the player, if you set the `behind` parameter it will be rendered behind the player.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern *hatname.png*, but you can also set some additional parameters in the file name by adding `_parametername` to the file name (before the *.png*).
    - Parameter `bounce`: This parameter determines whether the hat will bounce while you're walking or not.
    - Parameter `adaptive`: If this parameter is set, the Among Us coloring shader will be applied (the shader that replaces some colors with the colors that your character is wearing in the game). The color red (#ff0000) will be replaced with the primary color of your player and the color blue (#0000ff) with the secondary color. Also other colors will be affected and changed, you can have a look at the texture of the [Crewmate Hat](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/among-us-wiki/images/e/e0/Crewmate_hat.png) to see how this feature should be used.
    - Parameter `behind`: If this parameter is set, the main texture will be rendered behind the player.
  - `Flipped texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered instead of the Main texture, when facing the left.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_flip.png`.
  - `Back texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered behind the player.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_back.png`.
  - `Flipped Back texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered instead of the Back texture, when facing the left.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_back_flip.png`.
  - `Climb texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered in front of the player, when they're climbing.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_climb.png`.
- **Testing:** You can test your hat design by putting all the files in the `\SushiAssets\Test` subfolder of your mod folder. Then whenever you start a Freeplay game, you and all the dummies will be wearing the new hat. You don't need to restart Among Us if you change the hat files, just exit and reenter the Freeplay mode.

# Colors
Note: Lighter and Darker colors are assigned alternatingly, s.t. they are always balanced in a lobby.

# Roles

## Role Assignment

First you need to choose how many special roles of each kind (Impostor/Neutral/Crewmate) you want in the game.
The count you set will only be reached, if there are enough Crewmates/Impostors in the game and if enough roles are set to be in the game (i.e. they are set to > 0%). The roles are then being distributed as follows:
- First all roles that are set to 100% are being assigned to arbitrary players.
- After that each role that has 10%-90% selected adds 1-9 tickets to a ticket pool (there exists a ticket pool for Crewmates, Neutrals and Impostors). Then the roles will be selected randomly from the pools as long it's possible (until the selected number is reached, until there are no more Crewmates/Impostors or until there are no more tickets). If a role is selected from the pool, obviously all the tickets of that role are being removed.
- The Lovers and Mini are being selected independently (without using the ticket system) according to the spawn chance you selected. After that the Crewmate, Neutral and Impostor roles are selected and assigned in a random order.

**Example:**\
Settings: 2 special Crewmate roles, Crusader: 100%, Hacker: 10%, Tracker: 30%\
Result: Crusader is assigned, then one role out of the pool [Hacker, Tracker, Tracker, Tracker] is being selected\
Note: Changing the settings to Hacker: 20%, Tracker: 60% would statistically result in the same outcome .


## Morphling

The Morphling is an Impostor which can additionally scan the appearance of a player.\
After an arbitrary time they can take on that appearance for a set duration which can be changed in the options.\

- The Hacker sees the new color on the admin table.
- The color of the footprints changes accordingly (also the ones that were already on the ground).

- The shield indicator changes accordingly (the Morphling gains or loses the shield indicator).

The Neutral Killers enable multiple new outcomes of the game, listing some examples here:

- The Crew could be eliminated, then any alive Neutral Killer fight against the Impostors (or against another Neutral Killer, or a Crewmate Power role) (The Crew can still make a task win in this scenario)

The priority of each Neutral Killer win condition is the following:
1. Crewmate Mini lose by vote
2. Any Neutral Evil Win
3. Team Impostor wins by sabotage
4. Team Crew wins by tasks (also possible if the whole Crew is dead)
5. Lovers among the last three players win
6. Any Neutral Killer wins by outnumbering (When the Neutral Killer contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 Impostors left, and no other Neutral killers are alive and the same Neutral Killer contains no Lover)
7. Team Impostor wins by outnumbering (When the team Impostors contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 Neutral Killers and team Impostors contains no Lover)
8. Team Crew wins by outnumbering (When there is no player that is a Neutral Killer and the team Impostors left)

- The Crew can still win, even if all of their members are dead, if they finish their tasks fast enough (That's why converting the last Crewmate with tasks left into a Sidekick results in a task win for the crew.)

### **Faction: Crewmates**
The psychic is a crewmate who can ask the souls of dead players for information. Like the Mystic, the psychic will see the souls of the players who have died (after the next meeting) and can question them. They then gets random information about the soul or the killer in the chat. The souls only stay for one round, i.e. until the next meeting. Depending on the options, the souls can only be questioned once and then disappear.
\
**Questions:**
The souls will always prefer to answer with the role specific information first!

**Role specific:**
- Sheriff suicide: "Yikes, that Sheriff shot backfired."
- Active Lover dies: "I wanted to get out of this toxic relationship anyways."
- Passiv Lover suicide: "The love of my life died, thus with a kiss I die."
- Lawyer client kills Lawyer: "My client killed me. Do I still get paid?"
- Teamkill Team Jackal: "First they sidekicked me, then they killed me... BUT WHY?"
- Teamkill Impostor: "I guess they confused me for the Spy, is there even one?"
- Submerged o2-Kill: "Do I really need that mask for breathing?"
- Warlock self kill: "MAYBE I cursed the person next to me and killed myself. Oops."
- Scavenger/Janitor eats/cleans body: "Is my dead body some kind of art now or... aaand it's gone."

**Else random:**
- "I'm not sure, but I guess a darker/lighter color killed me."
- "If I counted correctly, then I died x seconds before the meeting started."
- "If my role hasn't been saved, there's no (role) in the game anymore."
- "It seems like my killer was the (role)."

**Chance That The Answer Contains Additional Information:**
- When you asked, x killer(s) was/were still alive.
- When you asked, x player(s) who can use vents was/were still alive.
- When you asked, x player(s) who is/are neutral but cannot kill was/were still alive.
